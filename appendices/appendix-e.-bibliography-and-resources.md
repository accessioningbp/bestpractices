# Appendix E. Bibliography and Resources

This bibliography was created by the National Best Practices for Archival Accessioning Working Group. It consists of resources that are cited in the Best Practices as well as sources that inform our understanding of accessioning work more broadly.

The bibliography retains the structure of the Best Practices. Practical resources such as tools and standards are listed at the top of each chapter heading, followed by works consulted.
