Successful accessioning depends on skilled workers who are empowered to act as effective stewards for the materials entrusted to the care of their repository. In support of this, it is imperative that individuals with supervisory responsibilities establish a workplace culture that values accessioning as a part of the organization’s holistic approach to archival practice. When properly supported, accessioning work offers an environment where individuals can self-manage their work and make decisions informed by their professional judgment and values.

## SECTION 13: ACCESSIONING LABOR IS MULTIFACETED <a href="#section13" id="section13"></a>

Accessioning is the result of both visible labor, which is frequently physical, and invisible labor, which may be intellectual or emotional. A successful accessioning archivist will display strong competencies in each of these domains:

* **Physical labor** is visible and obvious, even to those with little understanding of the work: collections are packed, received, stabilized, and shelved to facilitate immediate access or further processing. Despite its apparent simplicity, however, the physical work requires a conceptual understanding of provenance and original order, experience safely handling material across a broad spectrum of formats, and the ability to identify and manage conservation concerns.
* **Intellectual labor** is evident throughout appraisal activities and documentation of acquisitions. Critical thinking, autonomy in decision-making, and the ability to manage and prioritize multiple tasks are essential to these core activities.
* **Emotional labor** is the least visible and most difficult to quantify, but it is inherent in the work. Collection donors may be navigating grief, they may be ambivalent about parting with their materials, or they may have complicated feelings about their legacy or how the institution will safeguard it. When appraisal or packing of a collection happens in situ, the accessioning archivist will be stepping into the donor’s personal space and must simultaneously be a respectful guest and an efficient professional. “Diplomacy,” “caregiving,” and “soft skills” are blanket terms that gloss over the sometimes sharp edges of emotional situations that require both careful responses and clear strategic decisions.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 13.1 ➤  Treat accessioning positions as skilled, professional labor</mark> <a href="#bp13-1" id="bp13-1"></a>

Accessioning roles are often conceived as early career positions, either to decrease institutional costs or due to a lack of understanding of the work entailed. Accessioning work is not entry-level work, however. **Specialized skills and professional judgment, developed through education and experience, are required for successful outcomes.**

Consider the following:

* Informed appraisal decisions depend on **knowledge of the institution** and its collecting policies and strategies, as well as an **understanding of how to assess** materials for historical and research value.
* Navigating donor and creator concerns relating to privacy, restrictions and access, and rights issues requires **diplomacy, as well as strong communication and confident negotiation skills.**
* **Legal and financial acumen** are necessary in overseeing the documentation of transfer, deeds of gift, loans, or purchase agreements.
* The logistics of physical and digital transfers, and the corresponding management of real and virtual storage spaces, require **competency in planning and coordination.**
* Documentation and access work hinges on **knowledge of archival description standards and practices**, as well as the **ability to make informed decisions** about levels of description and priorities for processing.
* **Facility with specific technologies** is required to use and administer collection management systems and in the acquisition and transfer of born-digital materials.
* **Project management and supervisory experience** is helpful when coordinating multiple accessioning projects or when undertaking large retrospective accessioning initiatives.

## SECTION 14: BEST PRACTICES FOR CREATING ACCESSIONING POSITIONS <a href="#section14" id="section14"></a>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 14.1 ➤  Create permanent positions</mark> <a href="#bp14-1" id="bp14-1"></a>

Accessioning is an ongoing operational practice, and given the skills and expertise required, positions should be permanent, full time, and include benefits. The need for a thorough understanding of archival theory and practice and sound professional judgment should be reflected in the job title, rank, compensation, and opportunities for mobility and promotion. Because of the detrimental impact on both the individual worker and the institution, term positions for accessioning should be avoided.

#### GOING FURTHER 14.2 ➤  Advocate for positions with guaranteed protections and growth opportunities <a href="#bp14-2" id="bp14-2"></a>

It’s important to advocate for positions that provide the most support and growth opportunities, not only in terms of professional growth but also economic growth and job protections. For example, union positions provide routine wage increases, health and safety protections, and codify job responsibilities that protect skilled labor. Faculty positions at academic institutions may provide additional job security and opportunities for professional development. These types of positions create a larger pool of potential candidates and allow institutions to better identify individuals with the necessary skills and experience to succeed. They can also improve employee retention, resulting in accessioning work that is continuous and consistent. Understanding an institution’s collecting scope, its existing holdings, and its capacity to take in new acquisitions is critical knowledge that takes time to develop. Continuity of staffing leads to stronger relationships with donors and sellers, strengthens institutional memory, and ensures that the work remains aligned with long-term institutional goals.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 14.3 ➤  Clearly define the scope of work in job descriptions</mark> <a href="#bp14-3" id="bp14-3"></a>

Accessioning touches on many archival workflows. Without clarity on where accessioning begins and ends, a worker’s job may suffer from scope creep. Clearly state in the job posting if the position is focused only on accessioning work or if other responsibilities are included, such as reference, supervision, or instruction. Be transparent about the amount of labor that focuses on accessioning work. If accessioning is just one role out of many, identify what percentage of the job is dedicated solely to accessioning, and ground that percentage in realistic assessments of institutional size, staffing levels, and number of acquisitions typically received per year.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 14.4 ➤  Manage expectations for productivity</mark> <a href="#bp14-4" id="bp14-4"></a>

Establish productivity goals fairly and realistically, in a manner that is informed by the size and diversity of collections, and by other assigned responsibilities, while also providing flexibility in support of a human-centered work culture.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 14.5 ➤  Advocate for the institution’s accessioning program</mark> <a href="#bp14-5" id="bp14-5"></a>

Advocating for staff, resources, and training means documenting resource gaps or needs and tying them to professional and institutional goals. Maintaining statistics that track time spent on various components of the work, such as assessing collections, creating documentation, and physical stabilization activities, can make visible the amount of time and effort that goes into accessioning.

Sharing information about new acquisitions with other staff and institutional stakeholders through team meetings, social media posts, annual reports, or presentations can bring this work to life in ways that numbers don't—this includes providing contextual information on the collection creator, why the collection was acquired, and how it fits within the institution’s larger mission or collecting strategy.

#### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ➤  Look outside the box to demonstrate accessioning labor and success to stakeholders

Qualitative metrics go beyond simple data points like the number of collections acquired or the number of linear feet on the shelves. Consider tracking and celebrating adjacent activities supported through accessioning work, such as exhibits, instructional sessions, and reference support, and issues identified for further action, such as preservation, ethical, or legal concerns.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 14.6 ➤  Provide opportunities for professional development and skill enhancement</mark> <a href="#bp14-6" id="bp14-6"></a>

Accessioning is a human-driven process; thus, investing in staff is fundamental. Accessioning touches on the full lifecycle of collection stewardship, and professional development for accessioning archivists should reflect this. Accessioning archivists should have the opportunity to learn about tasks beyond those exclusive to accessioning, such as preservation and conservation, digital preservation, copyright law, data curation, and subjects related to the repository’s collecting areas.

Enhancement opportunities include peer-led professional development support (such as reading groups); free and fee-based classes and webinars; and regular attendance at local, regional, or national conferences. Accessioning archivists and their supervisors should advocate for financial support for learning opportunities whenever possible. Professional development is not just a commitment of funds but a commitment of time: keeping abreast of new developments in the field may require that other duties and responsibilities are occasionally reprioritized.

#### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ➤  Encourage contributions to the field

Giving back to the larger professional community through presentations, scholarly publications, and other forums raises the profile of both the individual and the institution. Lessons learned and shared improve the archival community as a whole and contribute to the ongoing development of professional practice. The continued growth of our profession’s understanding of accessioning depends on diverse contributions, particularly from practitioners actively engaged in this work.

## SECTION 15: PARTNERSHIPS IN ACCESSIONING <a href="#section15" id="section15"></a>

While the act of accessioning may be carried out independently, the actions the accessioning archivist takes throughout the process are informed, influenced, or directed by their relationships with many partners. Managing expectations and juggling the competing timelines and priorities of numerous stakeholders is a continual challenge.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 15.1 ➤  Empower the accessioner</mark> <a href="#bp15-1" id="bp15-1"></a>

When the accessioning archivist has decision-making authority and power equal to their level of responsibility, they will be better positioned to navigate the complex internal and external relationships involved in accessioning. Information sharing, knowledge transfer, and collaboration between all parties is vital, and the accessioning archivist must be supported from all sides—above, below, and in parallel. **Accountability without authority inevitably leads to frustration; however, trust, patience, flexibility, and open communication within and across these relationships will ultimately result in success.**

#### <mark style="color:blue;">BEST PRACTICE 15.2 ➤  Define internal and external partnership responsibilities</mark> <a href="#bp15-2" id="bp15-2"></a>

An institution that defines its accessioning workflows and determines who is responsible for each step in the process has taken a critical step toward positioning its accessioning program for success. The accessioning archivist is positioned at the center of a complex network of partnerships, and each partner must be clear about their role in the process, what they are expected to contribute, and what they expect to receive. Shared accountability for the outcome of accessioning is the responsibility of the entire network.

The following is an example list of the most common—and most crucial—partners. _Appendix C includes a detailed_ [_exploration of these partnerships_](../appendices/appendix-c.-partnerships-in-accessioning.md) _and a_ [_template and model for identifying local partners and examining relationships_](../appendices/appendix-d.-templates/)_._
