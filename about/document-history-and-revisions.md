### About Versioning

The Accessioning Best Practices uses semantic versioning, with interpretations borrowed from the Technical Subcommittee on _Describing Archives: A Content Standard_. Version numbers are represented in the following format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

**A major change** is understood as one that changes the interpretation so much as to make previous usage obsolete. It is also significant enough to warrant community feedback. Examples may include:

* Significant revision to the Guiding Principles
* Creating or deleting recommendations
* Creating a new appendix
* Making significant alterations to how an Accession Record element is used or defined
* Would the change make the answer to the question “Does this change how people use, educate, or write about it?” be “yes”?

**A minor change** is one that does not affect the application or interpretation of the Best Practices. Examples may include:

* Updating links
* Updating crosswalks based on changes to companion standards
* Adding use cases or examples

**A patch** or **bug fix** may include:

* Correcting a typo
* Correcting a grammatical error
* Correcting an error in Markdown
